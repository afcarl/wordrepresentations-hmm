HMM model for word representations, using the method of Huang + Yates (2009).

Implemented by Joseph Turian <firstname at lastname dot com>

============

USAGE

    * Edit hyperparameters.wordrepresentations-hmm.yaml or use command
    line flags. You will need integers files as the input.
    See these scripts:
        http://github.com/turian/common-scripts/blob/master/words-integers-mapfile.py
        http://github.com/turian/common-scripts/blob/master/words-to-integers.py
    For example:
        words-integers-mapfile.py < tiny.txt > integersmap-tiny.txt
        words-to-integers.py integersmap-tiny.txt < tiny.txt > integers-tiny.txt
    To get the vocabulary  for hyperparameters.wordrepresentations-hmm.yaml:
        wc -l integersmap-tiny.txt
        # 691

    * Run ./train.py on a file with mapped integers
        ./train.py < integers-tiny.txt

    * Decode a file with real words, not integers
        ./decode.py < tiny.txt

============

REQUIREMENTS

    * ghmm, with Python bindings
        http://ghmm.sourceforge.net/

    * common Python library by Joseph Turian
        http://github.com/turian/common

    * numpy
        For random initialization

============

WARNING

    * I have not checked with Huang and Yates to see if this
    implementation is correct.
    * I am not sure if my Baum-Welch stopping criterion is appropriate.
    * I do not know if the HMM initialization is correct.

============

TODO

    * Automatically do word mapping during train.py, not just decode.py
