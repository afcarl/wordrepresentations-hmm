HMM model for word representations, using the method of Huang + Yates (2009).

Implemented by Joseph Turian <firstname at lastname dot com>

============

USAGE

    * Edit hyperparameters.wordrepresentations-hmm.yaml or use command
    line flags. You will need integers files as the input.
    See this script:
        http://github.com/turian/common-scripts/blob/master/words-to-integers.py

    * Run ./train.py

REQUIREMENTS

    * ghmm, with Python bindings
        http://ghmm.sourceforge.net/

    * common Python library by Joseph Turian
        http://github.com/turian/common

    * numpy
        For random initialization

============

WARNING

    * I have not checked with Huang and Yates to see if this
    implementation is correct.
    * I am not sure if my Baum-Welch stopping criterion is appropriate.
    * I do not know if the HMM initialization is correct.
